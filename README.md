## Concept
I designed this guitar to combine the shapes of the Gibson Explorer and Fender Stratocaster designs.

|       Design Inspiration |

## Design

After prototyping in cardboard to ensure the design was ergonomic, I traced the above sketch into QCAD, an open-source 2D CAD program.
For the body design, I decided to use 3 aluminum plates. 

The electronics and the neck mounting plate are attached solely to the front plate, which makes repair easier. For the 3D CAD design, I used Autodesk Inventor.

The design consists of these 3 plates (rendered in QCAD). They are held together with 6-32 standoffs.
